           <h2>Super Mario Odyssey (スーパーマリオオデッセイ, Super Mario Odyssey)</h2>
            <p> Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D action-adventure platformer for the Nintendo Switch. It is the eighth 3D title of the Super Mario series; the first 3D Super Mario title for a hybrid console, being the sixth 3D Super Mario title on a home console after Super Mario 3D World; and the third 3D Super Mario title on a handheld console after Super Mario 64 DS and Super Mario 3D Land. In 2020, it was recognized as the the twentieth entry in the Super Mario series.[11] As of 2024, it is recognized as the twenty-first on Mario Portal.[12] It was first teased in the Switch's announcement video on October 20, 2016, and was formally announced as part of the Nintendo Switch presentation on January 13, 2017. The game was released in select regions on October 27, 2017;[13] in South Korea and Taiwan on December 1, 2017;[8][9] and in China on March 16, 2020.[10] The game features sandbox-like elements similar to those in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine and revolves around Mario exploring Earth-based settings with his new partner, Cappy.

                Unique to this game, Mario is able to throw Cappy onto certain enemies and objects, allowing Mario to take control of them and use their abilities. Mario can also dress in different costumes, several being based on the previous games. The game supports two-player co-op, allowing a second player to use a single Joy-Con or Pro Controller to control Cappy independently from Mario. The game also has online functionality, which allows players to compare their times/scores in certain events. In addition, amiibo can be used to unlock certain costumes early as well as obtain free hints toward the locations of Power Moons and regional coins.
                
                The Mario (Wedding Outfit), Peach (Wedding Outfit), and Bowser (Wedding Outfit) amiibo have designs based on this game and were released on the same day as Super Mario Odyssey. Additionally, Super Mario Cereal was released on December 11, 2017.[14] The cereal is based on this game, and the box is an amiibo that works with the game. Super Mario Odyssey is also one of the first styles added to Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo.

                The game won the Game of the Year award at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards (where it also won the other categories it was nominated for,
             except for Control Precision, which was won by Cuphead) and was also nominated for the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards 2017 and it lost to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Despite the loss, it won Best Family Game at the aforementioned ceremony.
