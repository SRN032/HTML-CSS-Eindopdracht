        <h3 class="CaptureText">Mario can capture spark pylons in order to become electricity and zip across power lines.

If there are collectible objects like Coins or a Power Moon close to a power line, Mario can leave the power line to collect them; this is done by pressing the  button or shaking the controller at the right time.
